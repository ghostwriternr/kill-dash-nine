# Hey!

I am Naresh. A final year student pursuing a Dual Degree (Bachelors + Masters) in Computer Science at IIT Kharagpur, India. The purpose of this blog would be to document some of my thoughts about all things code and Computer Science.

## So, what's with the name?

Guess #1: _Because you love Linux?_  
    Yeah I do. But that didn't inspire the name.  
  
Guess #2: _Monzy???_  
    YEP!
