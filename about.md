# Hey!

I am Naresh. I'm a software engineer at Intuit, Bangalore. I graduated with a Dual Degree (Bachelors + Masters) in Computer Science from IIT Kharagpur, India in the summer of 2018. The purpose of this blog would be to document some of my thoughts about all things code and computers.

## What's with the name?

Guess #1: _Because you love Linux?_\
    Yeah I do. But that's not all.

Guess #2: _Because you're a raging psycopath?_\
    **cough cough** No!

Guess #3: _Monzy???_\
    Y-E-S!
