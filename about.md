# Hi! 👋

I am Naresh. I'm a software engineer at Intuit, Bangalore. I graduated with a Dual Degree (Bachelors + Masters) in Computer Science from IIT Kharagpur, India in the summer of 2018. The purpose of this blog would be to document some of my thoughts about all things code and computers.

## What's with the name? 🤔

Guess #1: _Is it because you love Linux?_ 🐧  
    Yeah I do! 💖 But that's not all.

Guess #2: _Because you're a raging psycopath?_ 👽  
    **cough cough** No!

Guess #3: _Monzy???_ 🤓  
    Y-E-S!
