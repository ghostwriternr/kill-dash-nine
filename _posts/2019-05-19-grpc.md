# Introduction

> "Woah! I came in here looking for some nerdy info about gRPC - that fancy pants RPC framework everyone is talking about these days. But who is this CUTE monster above?"

Isn't he the cutest? The _cute monster_ is gRPC's mascot, **Pancakes**! Say Hello üê∂ Pancakes is here to help you get started with gRPC. This is his first time - so if you find any mistakes, please [raise an issue here](https://github.com/ghostwriternr/kill-dash-nine/issues) and we'll get it fixed stat! **Woof!**

## Alright! So what is this gRPC?

First, let's define RPC.

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call),
_"In distributed computing, a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is coded as if it was a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote."_

In Layman terms, it allows a programmer to call, say, a method or an API that could be running anywhere on a remote machine as if it was a part of the same codebase (i.e. it can be called like any other method using standard language semantics).
