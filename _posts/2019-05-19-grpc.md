# Introduction

"Woah! I came in here looking for some nerdy info about gRPC - that fancy pants RPC framework everyone is talking about these days. But who is this CUTE monster above?"

Isn't he the cutest? The _cute monster_ is gRPC's mascot, **Pancakes**! Say Hello üê∂

Pancakes is here with an extremely beginner-friendly introduction to gRPC. This is his first time - so if you find any mistakes, please [raise an issue here](https://github.com/ghostwriternr/kill-dash-nine/issues) and we'll get it fixed stat! **Woof!**

## What is RPC and why is it needed?

### Current scenario

As of today, the vast majority of web APIs on the internet are based on **HTTP + JSON**, with **[REST](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest)** as the architectural principle of how these APIs are designed. HTTP/REST has excellent implementations in every conceivable programming language out there and is extremely popular, but it isn't without it's problems. Some of the **major drawbacks of HTTP/REST** are:
- The client program (the caller) needs to build extra tooling for every new REST API it has to interact with to construct the request headers and payload. Or expect the REST API to come with a client library (in the same language as the client's implentation) so the functionality can be integrated easily.
- No formal machine-readable contract. This makes discovery impossible and writing client-libraries a manual job, for every programming language to be supported.
- Streaming is almost impossible.
- JSON is a text representation, making it extremely inefficient for transmission over network.
- A pure REST-ful paradigm can't model all the capabilities to be supported by the API (example: restarting a machine).

### What are the alternatives?

There are several, but in the current scope, we can look at RPC. RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a request-response protocol.

In Layman terms, RPC allows a program to call, say, a method or an API that could be running anywhere on a remote machine as if it were part of the same program (i.e. using standard language semantics without having to even think about network configurations) and get back a response. [Wikipedia has a more formal definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call), if interested.


## Welcome gRPC

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication.

gRPC evolved out as a V2 of Google's internal RPC solution - Stubby. gRPC solves all the problems listed above (and more!).

Some of the key features that makes gRPC stand-out are:
- Idiomatic client libraries in 10 languages
- Highly efficient on wire and with a simple service definition framework
- Bi-directional streaming with http/2 based transport
- Pluggable auth, tracing, load balancing and health checking
